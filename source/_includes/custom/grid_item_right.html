            I have a wide range of interests, from high-level, front-end work in JavaScript to close-to-the-metal, high perf applications in C, C++ and Rust. I've been recognized by the <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust Programming Language</a> team as a Friend-of-the-tree, reserved for contributors who've committed signifigant changes to the project.
